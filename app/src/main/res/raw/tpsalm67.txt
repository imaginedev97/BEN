Psalm 67

A Song of Thanksgiving[a]
67 God, be merciful to us and bless us;
    look on us with kindness,
2 so that the whole world may know your will;
    so that all nations may know your salvation.

3 May the peoples praise you, O God;
    may all the peoples praise you!

4 May the nations be glad and sing for joy,
    because you judge the peoples with justice
    and guide every nation on earth.

5 May the peoples praise you, O God;
    may all the peoples praise you!

6 The land has produced its harvest;
    God, our God, has blessed us.
7 God has blessed us;
    may all people everywhere honor him.
