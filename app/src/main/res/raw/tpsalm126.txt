Psalm 126

A Prayer for Deliverance
126 When the Lord brought us back to Jerusalem,[a]
    it was like a dream!
2 How we laughed, how we sang for joy!
    Then the other nations said about us,
    “The Lord did great things for them.”
3 Indeed he did great things for us;
    how happy we were!

4 Lord, make us prosperous again,[b]
    just as the rain brings water back to dry riverbeds.
5 Let those who wept as they planted their crops,
    gather the harvest with joy!

6 Those who wept as they went out carrying the seed
    will come back singing for joy,
    as they bring in the harvest.
