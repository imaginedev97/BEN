Psalm 23

The Lord Our Shepherd[a]
23 The Lord is my shepherd;
    I have everything I need.
2 He lets me rest in fields of green grass
    and leads me to quiet pools of fresh water.
3 He gives me new strength.
He guides me in the right paths,
    as he has promised.
4 Even if I go through the deepest darkness,
    I will not be afraid, Lord,
    for you are with me.
Your shepherd's rod and staff protect me.

5 You prepare a banquet for me,
    where all my enemies can see me;
you welcome me as an honored guest
    and fill my cup to the brim.
6 I know that your goodness and love will be with me all my life;
    and your house will be my home as long as I live.
