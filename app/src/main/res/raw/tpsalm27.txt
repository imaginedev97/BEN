Psalm 27

A Prayer of Praise[a]
27 The Lord is my light and my salvation;
    I will fear no one.
The Lord protects me from all danger;
    I will never be afraid.

2 When evil people attack me and try to kill me,
    they stumble and fall.
3 Even if a whole army surrounds me,
    I will not be afraid;
even if enemies attack me,
    I will still trust God.[b]

4 I have asked the Lord for one thing;
    one thing only do I want:
to live in the Lord's house all my life,
    to marvel there at his goodness,
    and to ask for his guidance.
5 In times of trouble he will shelter me;
    he will keep me safe in his Temple
    and make me secure on a high rock.
6 So I will triumph over my enemies around me.
    With shouts of joy I will offer sacrifices in his Temple;
    I will sing, I will praise the Lord.

7 Hear me, Lord, when I call to you!
    Be merciful and answer me!
8 When you said, “Come worship me,”
I answered, “I will come, Lord.”
9     Don't hide yourself from me!

Don't be angry with me;
    don't turn your servant away.
You have been my help;
    don't leave me, don't abandon me,
    O God, my savior.
10 My father and mother may abandon me,
    but the Lord will take care of me.

11 Teach me, Lord, what you want me to do,
    and lead me along a safe path,
    because I have many enemies.
12 Don't abandon me to my enemies,
    who attack me with lies and threats.

13 I know that I will live to see
    the Lord's goodness in this present life.
14 Trust in the Lord.
    Have faith, do not despair.
Trust in the Lord.
