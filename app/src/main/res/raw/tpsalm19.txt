Psalm 19

God's Glory in Creation[a]
19 How clearly the sky reveals God's glory!
    How plainly it shows what he has done!
2 Each day announces it to the following day;
    each night repeats it to the next.
3 No speech or words are used,
    no sound is heard;
4 yet their message[b] goes out to all the world
    and is heard to the ends of the earth.
God made a home in the sky for the sun;
5     it comes out in the morning like a happy bridegroom,
    like an athlete eager to run a race.
6 It starts at one end of the sky
    and goes across to the other.
    Nothing can hide from its heat.

The Law of the Lord
7 The law of the Lord is perfect;
    it gives new strength.
The commands of the Lord are trustworthy,
    giving wisdom to those who lack it.
8 The laws of the Lord are right,
    and those who obey them are happy.
The commands of the Lord are just
    and give understanding to the mind.
9 Reverence for the Lord is good;
    it will continue forever.
The judgments of the Lord are just;
    they are always fair.
10 They are more desirable than the finest gold;
    they are sweeter than the purest honey.
11 They give knowledge to me, your servant;
    I am rewarded for obeying them.

12 None of us can see our own errors;
    deliver me, Lord, from hidden faults!
13 Keep me safe, also, from willful sins;
    don't let them rule over me.
Then I shall be perfect
    and free from the evil of sin.

14 May my words and my thoughts be acceptable to you,
    O Lord, my refuge and my redeemer!
