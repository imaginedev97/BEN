Psalm 121

The Lord Our Protector
121 I look to the mountains;
    where will my help come from?
2 My help will come from the Lord,
    who made heaven and earth.

3 He will not let you fall;
    your protector is always awake.

4 The protector of Israel
    never dozes or sleeps.
5 The Lord will guard you;
    he is by your side to protect you.
6 The sun will not hurt you during the day,
    nor the moon during the night.

7 The Lord will protect you from all danger;
    he will keep you safe.
8 He will protect you as you come and go
    now and forever.
